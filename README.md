# Data-Structures-ED-2017-2018
Subject of the second year of software engineering Oviedo / Asignatura del segundo año de ingeniería del software Oviedo.

Hey there!
These are my laboratory deliveries which I presented for my evaluation of the subject. <br /> 
You should know that some of the code ( mostly in heap package ) is not finished or does not work as it should because of some fails in the implementation that i didnt have time yet to resolve. Also that part of the code is made by professors of the university.

Anyway some of the knowdledge that you can find in here are : <br />

- Algorithm benchmark
- Graphs
  - Generic graphs
  - Graph essentials
  - Adjacency Matrix
  - Adjacency List
  - Minimum cost path
  - The Dijkstra algorithm
  - The Floyd-Warshall algorithm
  - Depth-First Search
- Hierarchical Structures
    - AVL node/trees
    - BST node/trees
    - Binary Heap
    - Priority queue
- Dictionary Structures
    - AbstractHash
    - ClosedHashTable
    - HashNode
